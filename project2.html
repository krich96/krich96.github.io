      <h5>CEREGO - 2019-2020</h5>
      <p>Cerego is an adaptive learning platform designed around the science of memory.  Most new learning is forgotten within a week. Cerego helps students build knowledge that lasts using a distributed practice algorithm.  Content is used in higher education, corporate training, and the military.</p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <img src="img/project1a.png">

      <div class="callout overlay">


       <h5>COURSE MANAGEMENT WORKFLOWS WERE AWKWARD FOR CORPORATE CUSTOMERS</h5>

        <p><span class="emphasis">Cerego's platform was originally designed for the needs of textbook publishers</span> (such as McGraw Hill and Elsevier), who needed to create a library of adaptive learning content and export it into their respective 3rd party platforms. Over time the business grew to include a learning management system for small-to-medium sized businesses. Many features were built on top of the existing nagivation, and <span class="emphasis">corporate customers required a lot of training</span> to learn Cerego's course management workflow.  In particular, it was unexpected that content had to be built in a separate library and imported into a course.</p>
        <!-- <img src="img/oldnav.gif" style="width:100%;"> -->

        <p>Revamping the course management workflow required 2 design challenges: <span class="emphasis">(1) improve the overall platform navigation,</span> and <span class="emphasis">(2) redesign the course management interface </span> to include content creation.</p>

        <img src="img/project-graphic.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container">
     <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>

     <p>Before jumping into a design solution, we (a product manager and myself) further explored the problem space with several methods:</p>
     <p><span class="emphasis">1.  Data analysis</span> to audit usage of different course management features </p>
     <p><span class="emphasis">2.  Customer interviews</span> to assess the needs, goals, and workflows around course management</p>
     <p><span class="emphasis">3.  Employee interviews </span>to validate hypotheses about our new 'corporate trainer persona'</p>

     <p><span class="emphasis">Insights:</span> The data revealed that the typical corporate account launched approximately 25 courses with around 40 learners per course.  It also revealed that <span class="emphasis">some legacy features were rarely used,</span> such as course cloning and bulk course publishing.</p>

     <h5>THE BIG PAIN POINT: HAVING TO LEAVE A COURSE TO MAKE CONTENT</h5>
         <img src="img/wtf.png" alt="">
     <p>Employee and customer interviews confirmed the initial hypothesis that users <span class="emphasis">desired workflow was to first to create a course, and then build content directly inside the course.</span></p>

     <p>Despite this, around half of corporate trainers interviewed <span class="emphasis"> still required the abiity to share content between courses</span>. There were mixed needs around the type of sharing as well.  Some clients said it that it was important for copies to mirror the content of the original (and all changes made), whereas others wanted content to hard copy into other courses so editing was possible.</p>

    <div class="sharing-logic">
     <img src="img/model.png" alt="">
    </div>

     <p>Although it required more engineering work, we elected to make it possible for users to decide whether they wanted a hard copy or to accept edits from the master copy. The alternative solution of pushing edits out to courses from a master course, was deemed to be overly complex.</p>

    <div class="space"></div>
     <h3>Redesigning the Core Nav</h3>

     <P>The goals for this redesign was to improve the overall navigation for all signed-in users, and to move all content management into courses.  One big constraint was that the new design could not significantly impact the layouts of other parts of the platform.</p>

      <h5>ANATOMY OF THE CURRENT NAVIGATION</h5>

        <img class="shadow" src="img/nav1.png">
        <img src="img/sitemap.png" alt="">

      <p>In order to rethink the information architecture, I mapped all key areas and flows of the platform. The results helped me see several pages in Admin channel that could be grouped, or could be put lower in the hierarchy for account set-up. </p>

      <h5>TAKING STOCK</h5>
      <p>The results of the research and discovery phase surfaced several other frequent complaints with the current navigation:</p>

        <img class="shadow" src="img/sidenav.png">

      <h5>EXPLORING CONFIGURATIONS & SOLUTIONS</h5>

        <img class="shadow" src="img/iterations.png" alt="">
        <p>One of the goals of this project was to create a very simple navigation. In the end, In order to create a mobile-friendly experience, we opted to provide a single breadcrumb to take the user back up one level.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <h5>IN THE END, THE CHOICE WAS A SIMPLE NAV WITH BREADCRUMBS (CRAZY I KNOW)!</H5>
        <img class="shadow" src="img/newnav.png" style="width:100%"; alt="">
        <img src="img/chart.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>


    <div class="space"></div>


    <h3>Streamlining Course & Content Management</h3>
       <p>Luckily, it was easy to see examples in other learning management systems for how to integrate content management with course management. One of the key needs of our user persona uncovered in research were that it would be <span class="emphasis">helpful to get some high level stats on the course right away</span>.  Below are some of the other insights about our current course detail page uncovered in our research:</p>
        <img src="img/old-courses.png">
        <p>Beside integrating content management into courses, another goal for the project was <span class="emphasis">to have both courses and content searchable from the main Courses page. </span> </p>
     </div>


  <img src="img/wires.png" style="margin:40px auto; display:block; max-width:100%">
  <div class="section-container">
    <h5>WIREFRAMING AND USER TESTING</h5>
      <p>The design process began with journeymaps and sketching paper prototypes.  As I developed tables for courses, I validated my assumptions with customers to make sure the headings were the most valuable.</p>
      <p>Iterations became digital, with increasingly higher fidelity. Using Invision, we tested a medium-fidelity course management prototype with 3 newer customers in our target vertical.</p>
    <span class="emphasis">The results showed:</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emphasis">ALL</span> could navigate to a specific course from the homepage</li>
      <li><span class="emphasis">ALL</span> knew how to add an assignment to a course </li>
      <li><span class="emphasis">2 of 3</span> could publish a course (this prompted an iteration)</li>
      <li><span class="emphasis">2 of 3</span> could add goals and due dates to assignments (this prompted an iteration) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One key finding was that users wanted more clarification on how due dates would behave for users (ex: what happened after the date passed).  We opted to put a help button above each table to address questions.</p>
    <h3 class="margin-top">Final designs: multiple states</h3>
    <img class="shadow" src="img/empty@2x.png">

    <h6 class="margin-top underline">Full course list</h6>

    <p>This project launched in April 2020. As of early August, the customer success team reported that their customer onboarding time has been reduced by roughly 30-40%, and the NPS has increased by 14% so far. Other KPI metrics were seen the increasing activity of new trial users:</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Users completing the Cerego Science learning set:</span> 12.37% before | 29.22% post | 142% increase</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Users creating a course: </span> 12.5% before | 31.69% post | 153% increase</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Users creating an item:</span>  4.38% before | 12.03% post | 174% increase </p>

<p>We are confident this redesign will improve the user experience for our target customer, and I look forward to following the results of this launch.</p>
